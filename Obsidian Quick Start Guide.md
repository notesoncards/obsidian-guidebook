## YAML Metadata

Adding YAML metadata "front-matter" to a note will expose _Properties_ of the note that can later be queried and filtered.

Each YAML metadata block starts on the first line of the note, with three-dashes: `---`

Each YAM property has a name, a colon as a delimiter, and then the associated valued, like: `title: "This is the note title"`.

Each YAML metadata block ends with another set of three dashes: `---`. After that you can add the contents, or "body", of the note itself.
